# Improving Safety and Increasing Production by Detecting Complex Work in Manufacturing Industry
This research investigates the application of Image
captioning in garments sector to increase production and
provide safety from workload imbalance.Though Bangladesh
is a second largest garments manufacturing country, it often
fails to meet the production goals in due time.Moreover It
is unable to meet the safety standards of the industry losing
contract from International buyers. In this paper we outlined
the application of image caption to detect complex work using
non invasive CCTV camera.We also tried to derive time for
such work using graph matching.In this paper we showed
how time derived from Deep learning neural network and
graph matching can be used to increase efficiency and reduce
safety issues due to fatigue.Besides this paper represents a
mitigation way and a proposed model in production line to
tackle problems related to safety and production that will help
the top management.
